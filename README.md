Boba PrioTool
=============

> Successfully prioritizing and eliminating targets since 1980

*some famous bounty hunter*

This tool is supposed to guide you through the *difficult* process of **prioritizing an item list** by divding it into a series of **binary choices** that are *easier* to make.

It was created as client-side-only JavaScript web app in a **very** "MVP-Agile-hacky" way.
However, the tool does what it is supposed to be doing, for now :-)

Why Boba?
---------

> This tool does some kind of BubbleSort, right?

*some family member of mine*

* Apparently Boba is another name for the famous Asian beverage [bubble tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boba_tea).
* Boba is also the first name of some badass bounty hunter from Star Wars, [Boba Fett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boba_Fett), hence the logo.

**TODO**:

- code refactoring: function Java doc comments 
- code refactoring: remove duplicate code
- code refactoring: turn methods into functions
- code refactoring: separate GUI logic from data / business logic
- code class modularity -> separate file
- Data persistence (DOM Storage / Cookie / Client side) : 2

- text hint boxes should be hidden and only appear once the step can be done : 5
- progress bar : 2
- server side coding : 0
- introduce OOP
- show combination matrix
- decision boxes with comment fields on why the decision was taken (advanced for storing/processing)

**DONE**:

- class safety
- versioning : 10
- undo buttons (indirectly) : 6
- decision boxes with comment fields on why the decision was taken (basic for printing)
- create Boba (Fett) favicon
- code refactoring: for loops
- code refactoring: console debug output
- code refactoring: variable names
- code refactoring: comments + let/const
- Helpbox with advice on how to make a decision (first content, Bootstrap Affix not yet working)
- More text that guides user : 8
- come up with a better name than Prioritizer (Bubble?) -> Bubble -> Bubble Tea -> Boba -> Boba Fett
- integrated jQuery / Bootstrap JS
